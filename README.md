# Salt Presentations

This repo contains all of the (modern) talks I have created and delivered regarding [SaltStack](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/) use-cases, usually at Meetups.

Here is the current list:

* [A Mini-Workshop For SaltStack Beginners](./mini-workshop/)
* [An introduction to extending SaltStack with custom modules](./eink-weather/)
* [Extending the SaltStack Event Bus to integrate external systems](./nhlevents/)
